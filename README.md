Monitoring:

1) Prometheus is an open-source monitoring tool, and Grafana is a visualization dashboard for metrics
   and traces of the infrastructure that we provision and configure for alerting.

2) Datadog is a commercial product for infrastructure monitoring and application performance management (APM).

I have included this here for installing the Datadog agent on remote machines, specifically AWS EC2 instances
  using Ansible automation.
